0.04,in this video I'm going to explain how
1.439,to train for Pure muscle growth and I'm
3.36,going to lay out five crucial
4.96,bodybuilding principles that must be
6.68,followed to maximize your muscular
8.36,development this video isn't about how
10.0,to get stronger it isn't about how to
11.519,get both bigger and stronger this video
13.759,is about maximizing pure muscle
17.08,gain chapter one tension is
21.4,King okay so the first non-negotiable
24.039,principle is that tension is King at
26.48,this point tension is universally
28.199,recognized as the primary factor driving
30.439,muscle growth tension is the force that
32.0,our muscles experience when they stretch
33.879,and contract under load if you think of
35.92,each muscle fiber as a rope in a tug of
37.8,war that stretching and pulling on the
39.84,rope is tension that tension then causes
42.36,a biochemical signaling Cascade that
44.32,ultimately tells the muscle it needs to
45.96,grow bigger so how do we maximize
47.84,tension on a muscle well answering that
50.16,question leads us into the four
51.84,remaining
53.359,principles chapter 2 use bodybuilding
57.519,technique to ensure maximum tension we
60.0,need to perform exercises using a
62.12,specific type of technique that I'm
64.0,calling bodybuilding technique this
66.0,technique is different from powerlifting
67.68,technique and it's different from how
69.2,most people lift I was at an LA Fitness
71.04,Gym the other day and I noticed just how
72.96,few people actually use bodybuilding
74.92,technique almost nobody was taking all
77.04,the boxes the first box is lifting tempo
79.759,for bodybuilding we generally want a
81.36,controlled 2 to 4 second negative if
83.799,you're used to just letting the weight
85.079,free fall this will feel quite slow at
87.04,first but this is important because
88.52,research shows that the lower phase or
90.68,the Ecentric is very likely more
93.0,important for muscle growth in the
94.52,positive phase or concentric yet for
96.96,whatever reason most people lift as if
99.159,the opposite were true most people just
100.96,try to get the weight up and then forget
103.0,about lowering it back down especially
105.159,as they get tired toward the end of a
106.88,set but this is a mistake because the
108.68,Reps toward the end of a set are the
110.399,most hypertrophic and the negative is
112.64,the most important part of each rep so
115.0,you really want to control and resist
116.799,the negative especially on those last
118.64,few reps new res search also indicates
120.68,that for muscle hypertrophy slower
122.479,Ecentric movements should be paired with
124.759,faster concentric movements this means
126.96,that while you want to go nice and slow
128.36,on the negative you should be more
129.959,forceful and explosive on the positive
132.48,so if I'm doing a hack squat I'm
134.0,thinking control control control on the
136.48,way down and then speed as I explode on
139.519,the way up on lateral raises I'm
141.16,resisting the weight on the way down and
142.879,then driving the dumbbells up and out
144.599,forcefully on the positive the same
146.68,tempo should apply to most exercises in
148.68,your routine next bodybuilding technique
150.76,means using a proper range of motion
152.959,usually this means using a full range of
154.64,motion so you get to at least parallel
156.599,on squat type exercises and ideally a
158.8,bit below parallel you bring the
160.2,dumbbells all the way down on presses
162.08,until you feel a nice deep stretch in
163.64,your pecs and on pull-ups you go all the
165.44,way up and all the way down however
167.319,there is some important Nuance here
168.879,because recently a number of Studies
170.28,have shown that full range of motion
172.08,isn't always better for muscle growth
173.72,partial reps are sometimes more
175.04,effective but only when they're done in
176.76,the stretched aspect of the lift in
178.76,other words the stretch stretched part
180.48,is more hypertrophic than the squeezed
182.56,part so the bottom half of a cable curl
184.92,is more important than the top half of a
186.76,cable curl the bottom half of a squat is
189.12,more important than the top half of a
190.799,squat so you may not necessarily always
192.84,need to use a full range of motion but
194.599,you do need to get the muscle
195.76,sufficiently stretched while lifting to
197.68,maximize hypertrophy so if you're not
199.519,feeling a deep stretch at the bottom of
201.04,the range of motion you should try to
202.64,find that stretch by going a bit deeper
204.72,if going deeper causes you pain or
206.319,serious discomfort you can work on any
208.12,flexibility or Mobility deficit or you
210.319,can find a different exercise that
211.68,allows you to reach that deep stretch
213.319,because it really is that important
215.08,another thing I've been noticing a lot
216.2,at the gym is that most people do quite
218.04,a lot of cheating on their form probably
220.72,too much cheating to maximize muscle
222.4,growth that's because you can move the
223.879,weight without actually applying much
225.439,tension to the Target muscle for example
227.84,if I curl the weight up while leaning
229.799,back and forth I'm shifting tension away
231.92,from the biceps and onto the lower back
234.159,so we want to ensure that the target
235.76,muscle is receiving most of the tension
237.68,which means keeping momentum under
239.28,control
241.519,chapter three
244.599,effort you need to push sets hard and
247.2,unfortunately research consistently
249.0,shows that most people simply don't push
251.04,their sets hard enough to maximize
252.68,muscle growth it's very common to see
254.439,people hitting the gym year after a year
256.199,but making no noticeable progress in
258.239,most cases this isn't because they'
259.88,maxed out their natural potential
261.519,instead it's usually because they simply
263.44,aren't pushing their sets close enough
264.84,to failure to stimulate new hypertrophy
267.24,so how hard is hard enough and how
269.24,important is going to failure well since
271.32,I published my last video on this topic
272.919,there's been a bombshell of a new meta
274.479,analysis that is the science-based
276.0,lifting Community buzzing and I need to
277.919,update a few things first I want to
279.72,quickly announce that I just launched my
281.24,new pure bodybuilding program for
282.84,pre-order over on Jeff
298.56,ner.me example here's a sneak peek at
300.88,week one day one of the full body
302.84,version of the program we start with
304.4,three sets of cross body lat pull rounds
306.8,which offer an insane stretch on the
308.36,lats then we do low incline Smith
310.32,machine press for the pecs Which is less
312.08,demanding than a freee barbell press
313.96,then it's on to machine hip adductions
315.639,to get the legs nice and warmed up for
317.039,leg press again another low impact
319.24,exercise that we can push harder without
321.4,generating tons of fatigue and then we
323.36,finish with some face PS and cable
324.8,crunches so by prioritizing exercises
327.12,that are less costly recoverywise we're
329.6,able to push them much closer to failure
331.479,without feeling completely wrecked
333.0,anyway you can pre-order the full 10we
334.6,plan at 30% off for the pre-sale and
336.84,I'll put a link to that in the
337.84,description box down below so this is
339.44,the new meta analysis which found that
341.039,as you get closer and closer to failure
343.0,the more muscle growth you tend to see
344.919,and this is their bombshell figure that
346.759,you've probably seen floating around
348.12,online here on the x-axis we have reps
350.12,in reserve so this point here at zero
352.36,would be failure where you couldn't do
354.0,another rep if you tried this point
355.56,would be two rep shy of failure this
357.44,would be 10 rep shy of failure all the
359.24,way to down to 22 rep shy of failure
361.68,which would basically just be the
363.0,easiest set imaginable and then here on
364.68,the y- axis is muscle growth and as you
366.68,can see from the trend line as you get
368.28,closer and closer to failure you see
370.039,more and more muscle growth in fact as
372.039,you go from two reps in the tank to zero
373.919,reps in the tank muscle growth really
375.599,spikes up so naturally a lot of people
377.84,who endorse high-intensity to failure
379.72,training have been using this study to
381.479,make their case that if you want to
382.919,maximize muscle growth you need to push
384.88,sets all the way to failure and I do
386.8,think they have a pretty good case for
388.08,that training approach with this step
389.919,however what I haven't seen them showing
391.68,is this other brand new meta analysis
393.759,from 2022 which pulled 15 studies based
396.599,on slightly different inclusion criteria
398.8,and came to a different conclusion quote
400.88,there is no evidence to support that
402.24,resistance training performed to
403.52,momentary muscular failure is superior
405.68,to non-failure resistance training for
407.639,muscle hypertrophy so what's going on
409.72,here well it seems that depending on
411.479,which specific studies you include and
413.52,how you run the statistics you can
415.24,either come away from this body of
416.599,science thinking that going all the way
418.4,to failure really really is a lot better
420.199,for muscle growth or that going all the
422.16,way to failure doesn't actually offer a
423.759,meaningful benefit over stopping a few
425.56,reps shy the evidence is conflicting so
427.96,what should we do practically speaking
429.879,well this is my takeaway do two to three
431.96,sets on most exercises and take the last
434.319,set all the way to failure for the first
436.199,one or two sets leave one or two reps in
438.12,the tank if you were to go to failure on
440.039,all sets you'd most likely be very
442.039,fatigued by the last set which means
443.759,you'd get less reps and hit less volume
445.759,as a result we know from other research
447.639,that volume is also important for muscle
449.44,growth up to a point now rather than do
451.24,a full deep dive on training volume I'll
452.96,just put a text summary up here on
454.44,screen that you guys can pause and read
456.08,for more detail on that so leave a few
457.84,reps in the tank for the earlier sets
459.52,and send it to Hell on the last set I
461.639,also pretty much always leave a rep or
463.08,two in the tank on heavy free weight
464.919,compound exercises like squats bench
467.12,presses and deadlifts even on the last
469.159,set simply because going to failure is
470.84,so disproportionately fatiguing that
472.72,it's not worth the risk on these
474.039,movements but that's also part of the
475.479,reason why those exercises aren't
476.919,emphasized in my pure bodybuilding
478.36,program
480.24,chapter four give your muscles a reason
482.639,to
483.8,grow to build bigger muscles we need to
486.199,give them a good reason to grow if we
488.36,keep doing the exact same thing week
490.08,after week and month after month our
491.8,muscle growth will fairly quickly
493.28,Plateau so to keep things progressing
495.56,you need to apply the progressive
497.28,overload principle where you aim to
499.24,increase some training variable from
501.039,week to week now there are a few main
502.599,ways to apply Progressive overload
504.4,specifically for bodybuilding first you
506.199,can add reps at the same amount of
507.84,weight for example on bicep curls you
509.72,could do three sets of 10 in week 1
511.44,three sets of 11 in week two three sets
513.399,of 12 in week three and then in week
515.2,four you could either go for 13 reps or
517.24,you could add some weight and return
518.56,back to 10 reps and then start adding
520.399,reps again this type of progression is
522.24,usually better for moderate to high rep
523.959,zones you can also add weight at a fixed
526.12,rep count for example on hack squats you
528.32,could do three sets of six reps with
530.0,three plates per side in week one and
532.08,then add 10 lounds to each side each
534.0,week until eventually you build up to
535.64,four plates per side for the same three
537.839,sets of six reps this type of
539.48,progression is usually better for lower
541.279,to moderate rep zones eventually you'll
543.24,have a week where you're not able to add
544.68,weight or reps and in this case you
546.6,should focus on improving some aspect of
548.64,your Technique you can try to control
550.16,the negative better use less momentum on
551.88,the positive or improve your range of
553.519,motion I still count this as Progressive
555.36,overload because it increases tension on
557.48,the target muscle as a final option you
559.279,can try to improve your mind muscle
560.839,Connection by really focusing on feeling
563.24,the target muscle working better
564.68,research has shown that the Mind muscle
566.16,connection can increase hypertrophy in
567.92,some cases and while may not be as
569.76,effective as adding weight or reps or
571.16,improving technique it's still worth
572.839,keeping in mind especially on isolation
575.079,exercises where traditional overloading
576.92,becomes impractical at a certain point
578.64,of strength
580.2,development chapter five choose high
582.88,tension
584.48,exercises because tension is King we
586.72,need to make sure that we're choosing
588.16,exercises that place high levels of
590.0,tension on the target muscles and this
592.36,is where I may lose some of you so I
594.0,want to reiterate that this advice is
595.839,directed at pure hypertrophy training
598.2,not strength training or hybrid training
600.44,and so while it is true that you can
601.76,build a great physique by only using
603.48,barbell exercises like the squat bench
605.56,press and deadlift especially if you
607.079,throwing in a pullup in a freee row this
609.2,approach is probably too basic to
611.32,maximize muscle growth that's for two
613.36,reasons for one there will be smaller
615.44,muscles that go under stimulated if this
617.399,is literally all you do muscles like the
619.399,biceps side delts hamstrings and calves
621.8,won't be getting enough love and
623.32,secondly some of these exercises don't
625.279,have the best stimulus to fatigue ratio
627.64,this is a term coined by Dr Mike isrel
629.76,and it essentially means exactly what it
631.399,sounds like the stimulus part mainly
633.24,refers to how much tension the exercise
635.16,delivers to the Target muscle and the
636.92,fatigue part refers to how fatiguing the
639.16,exercise is or how hard it is to recover
641.519,from so for example the deadlift offers
643.72,a high stimulus because it places a lot
645.68,of tension on the glutes and the spinal
647.24,Erectors which is great but it also
649.36,carries a very high fatigue demand it's
651.68,really hard to recover from which isn't
653.399,as great from a bodybuilding perspective
655.32,so for Pure hypertrophy we want to at
657.16,least air toward exercises that have
659.04,have a high stimulus to fatigue ratio
661.6,now this doesn't mean that any exercise
663.279,that causes fatigue is bad fatigue is an
665.56,inevitable and necessary part of
667.2,training but generally speaking if we
669.399,can pick an exercise that offers just as
671.519,high or higher of a stimulus for Less
674.0,fatigue that's going to be a good pick
676.12,and machine and cable based exercises
678.12,are some of the best options for this
679.76,they provide massive tension for Less
681.76,fatigue than free weights and also tend
683.68,to be safer to take to failure research
685.68,also shows that contrary to popular
687.48,belief machines are at least as
689.32,effective as free weights in stimulating
691.04,hypertrophy and some evidence suggests
692.959,that they may be superior in some cases
695.079,this shouldn't be super surprising
696.36,because machines and cables tend to have
698.0,fantastic resistance profiles where you
700.279,get this smooth even tension throughout
702.6,the range of motion for example with the
704.519,standard free weight dumbbell curl your
706.12,biceps reach their highest level of
707.68,tension when the elbow is at 90° and
710.16,experience virtually zero tension when
711.92,the bicep is fully stretched at the
713.36,bottom by contrast the face away basan
715.44,cable curl offers much more continuous
717.6,tension on the biceps through about the
719.2,range of motion including in that
720.68,important stretch position at the bottom
722.639,now I don't want to overstate the
723.92,superiority of machines and cables free
725.92,weights have some advantages too they're
727.56,more accessible they tend to have better
729.079,strength carryover and they may activate
730.959,smaller stabilizers better and I'm still
732.959,a fan of the barbell I love the squat
734.639,bench and deadlift and I think that
736.04,strength can fit neatly into a
737.48,hypertrophy plan if programmed correctly
739.959,but if we're designing a program purely
741.68,dedicated to muscle growth that's a
743.36,recovery wrinkle we don't need to worry
745.0,about plus we already know that having
746.839,some exercise variety and Novelty is
748.72,good good for muscle growth and doing
750.32,the same exercises month after month and
752.16,year after year can get stale there are
754.279,a few other things that can impact
755.56,muscle growth but are relatively less
757.32,important your training split is
758.839,essentially just a way of organizing
760.24,your workouts throughout the week and as
761.959,long as it fits your schedule allows you
763.6,to push your sets hard do enough volume
765.68,and recover between workouts it'll work
767.72,just fine full body routines upper lower
769.8,splits push P leg splits and even
771.639,modified body part splits are all
773.519,effective options also rest periods seem
775.76,to matter somewhat for muscle growth
777.32,resting at least 1 minute between sets
779.24,is generally better than resting for
780.72,less than 1 minute so be careful not to
782.48,rush through your workout as it can
784.0,limit your recovery between sets and
785.88,then there are specialized hypertrophy
787.32,techniques like long length partials
789.0,myor reps and drop sets which can all be
791.16,helpful for driving continued progress
793.079,beyond the beginner stage I'm going to
794.8,cover at least five or six of these
796.199,techniques in an upcoming miniseries so
798.079,make sure you're subscribed and have a
799.44,lookout for that within the next month
801.079,and again if you're looking for a
802.04,program to Kickstart some new growth I'd
803.72,recommend checking out my pure
804.839,bodybuilding program over on Jeff
807.76,ner.me 30% off you'll also get the
810.399,hypertrophy handbook sent to you right
812.279,away which covers everything you need to
813.76,know about training for muscle growth
815.24,and you'll get the pure bodybuilding
816.36,nutrition booklet right away so you can
818.04,get your diet on track as well you'll
819.48,also get all three versions of the pure
821.16,bodybuilding program when you pre-order
822.88,so you'll get the push pull legs full
824.399,body and upper lower versions of the
826.279,program after the pre-order week is over
828.24,you'll just select which one version of
829.88,the program you want unless you want to
831.519,buy all three separately each version of
833.24,the program also includes a weak points
835.04,and arm day so you can prioritize
837.0,whatever your individual weak point is
839.079,and I included the dedicated arm workor
840.759,because it's a really fun workout it's a
842.6,great pump and arms are super important
844.36,for bodybuilding this is definitely not
846.0,like any of my other programs and I
847.639,filmed over 200 private exercise demos
850.48,specifically for this program that each
852.48,come with specific coaching cues and
